# Gutenberg_Text_Classification
Classifying a dataset of texts from Project Gutenberg by author

Project Gutenberg is an online library of public domain books. I have downloaded a corpus of a subset of Project Gutenberg works to
analyze using natural language processing tools. My main interest is to atttempt to classify texts by author. I have two notebooks,
one of which is to preprocess the data and strip the title from the beginning and the author's name throughout each text so as not to
add bias. The other is to use machine learning to classify the data.
